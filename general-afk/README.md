# General AFK

I made this as just a generic idle notification.

I have it coupled with the idle notifier plugin which sends a chat message of "You are now idle!" based off character animation.

This is set to force focus on the window, soft red flash, and put a chat message. 

Might be excessive notifications but it was a fun mockup so maybe someone else will enjoy it.
