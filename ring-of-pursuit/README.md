# Ring of Pursuit

Simple notification that watches for your ring of pursuit to proc and ping you.
I made this so I could basically just spam world hop and click on the hole waiting for my ring to proc.
Has vastly simplified razor backed kebbits and I assume anything that requires noose wand!

When your ring procs - the screen will softly blink red and a very subtle ping to let you know.
