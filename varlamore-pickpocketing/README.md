# Varlamore Pickpocketing

This alert group contains an alert that lets you know as soon as a wealthy citizen is distracted by a street urchin by flashing red twice, and giving a system tray notification and a TTS alert that "A wealthy citizen is distracted."

It also has delayed notifications by 85 seconds (a street urchin distracts a wealthy citizen roughly every 90 seconds) with a TTS telling you to get ready, and it flashes green twice and forces focus of the RuneLite client.

It also includes an alert to let you know when your coin pouches reach a certain threshold. This way, you dont waste any of your auto pickpocket chances due to holding too many coin pouches. You will want to adjust this yourself depending on your Ardougne diary completion level. Note that if you click the wealthy citizen as soon as they are distracted, you will get between 15 and 17 coin pouches, so take that into account as well when determining your threshold.
