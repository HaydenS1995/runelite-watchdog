# Pyramid Plunder

This group intends to make it more obvious when your character is active after searching for exits and opening urns. Has pleasant alert sounds (that you can adjust) that sound better than playing with default RS sound on. LMK what you think or if you have any recommendations!

Best if used in conjunction with Pyramid Plunder plugin

- Plays sound and displays overhead text when failing to pick-lock the door
- Plays sound and displays overhead text when the tomb door is a dead end
- Plays sound and displays overhead text when your character is active after a successful urn search
- Plays sound when you fail an urn search.
